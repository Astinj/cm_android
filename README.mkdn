Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Android, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/download/using-repo).

To initialize your local repository, use this command:

    repo init -u git://github.com/voku/cm_android.git -b gingerbread

Then to download the files:

    repo sync -j15

Prepare for build:

    . build/envsetup.sh
    lunch spica-eng
    vendor/spica/get-google-files -v mdpi

Build recovery zip:

    mka otapackage -j4
